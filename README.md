    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a two-column layout on larger screens and a stacked layout on mobile. A persistent navigation sidebar on the left allows users to select a music genre. The main content area on the right dynamically updates to display detailed information about the selected genre. This master-detail structure was chosen for its high usability, allowing users to easily and quickly compare different genres without losing context or needing to scroll extensively. A summary chart is included at the bottom to provide an alternative, quantitative view of the data. This non-linear exploration encourages user interaction and discovery. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: Full list of genres. Goal: Navigation/Organization. Viz/Method: Clickable styled buttons in a sidebar. Interaction: Click to update main content. Justification: Provides clear, persistent navigation. Library: HTML/CSS/JS.
        - Report Info: Genre details (Explanation, Instruments, Iconic Thing). Goal: Inform. Viz/Method: Dynamic text blocks in a main content panel. Interaction: Content updates based on navigation selection. Justification: Centralizes information display for focused reading. Library: JS DOM manipulation.
        - Report Info: Key Instruments list. Goal: Inform/Compare. Viz/Method: Styled "pills" or "tags". Interaction: Static display. Justification: Enhances visual appeal and scannability over a plain list. Library: HTML/Tailwind CSS.
        - Report Info: Number of instruments per genre (derived). Goal: Compare. Viz/Method: Horizontal Bar Chart. Interaction: Static visual comparison. Justification: Adds a quantitative, at-a-glance comparison of instrumental complexity, enhancing the report's value. Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
